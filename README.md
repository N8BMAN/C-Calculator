# Calculator 2: This Time .NET Edition

This was a school project I worked on. Has all basic calculator functions as well as Integrals and Gamma functions (both of which are approximations)

Built with Visual Studio 2017 and WPF

BASIC OPERATION:
    Works like any other calculator.
    - The up and down arrows (and buttons) iterate through previously entered expressions
    - The format for Integrals is âˆ«(lowerLimit,upperLimit,function)
    - Dyslexic Mode with high contrast and font changes
